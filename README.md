Control the speed of Brushless Motor

## Brushless Motor
Brushless Motor is one type of Dc Motor it is called BLDC motor and it is used in many applications such as Drone and electrical scooters As well as some electric bikes

This is Brushless Motor with 12 poles as we can see above in Figure each pole means an inductor in the picture we have 3 color thatâ€™s mean we have three inductors let these three inductors A, B, and C

As we can see, it is surrounded by magnetic and divided into North (N) and south (s). These poles attract and repel so that the Brushless Motor can move in a circular motion.

#### ESC
ESC is Electronic Speed control. It consists of 6 transistors used to change the speed of an electric motor and its route and perform as a dynamic brake. These are frequently used on radio-controlled models which are electrically powered, with the change most frequently used for brushless motors providing an electronically produced 3-phase electric power low voltage source of energy for the motor.

A2212/13T
1000KV

22mm: Diameter (width)

12mm: Hight

13T: The number of turns of the inductor

1000KV: Number of turns for each voltage. That means 1000 turns for each voltage
